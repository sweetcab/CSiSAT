# CSiSAT
A constraint solver with random variables

## Introduction

CSiSAT is a constraint solver for constraints with random variables. It will computte the probability (lower and upper bounds) of 
satisfaction of the constraints.

## Implementation

The prototype implementation of CSiSAT is implemented by using C++ programming
language with approximately 8000 lines of source code1. The source code is implemented
and tested on Ubuntu 15.10 with a 64-bit PC and is available at [CSiSAT Homepage](https://vhome.offis.de/~ygao/)
